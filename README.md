### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a disruptive commercial project in stealth mode.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Qt6 (with C++17), Elixir lang and Phoenix framework.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on knowledge commons, Web3 and the Fediverse.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with open education, teleworking and crowdfunding.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Ù‚ØµØ§Ø¦Ø¯, fÃºtbol 4-4-2, å›´æ£‹ 19Ã—19, Bibliotheken und Literatur.
- ðŸ“« I live on my own server with presence on [ActivityPub](https://mastodon.social/@amstalks) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@amstalks:matrix.org) protocols.
- âš¡ Finally, I mainly depend on Codeberg and Gitea instead of GitHub for version controlling. However, this account is just for exploring and showcasing. Join the free-culture movement and participate in open innovation for public benefit.
